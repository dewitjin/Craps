## Synopsis

This App is my version of a dice game called CRAPS.  It is built using C++ and runs directly in terminal.

If you win the game, you will get a password and will be directed to a locked page.  After entering the password, you will be able to see some cool stuff.

## Code Example

No code example.

## Motivation

I am currently learning C++ at school and decided to build something with the language.

## Installation

This App was compiled using the C++ compiler shipped with my Mac.  If you want to modify it, pull down the files and modify in your preferred IDE.  Then to re-compile on a MAC, cd into the directory where the files are and type:

g++ diceGame.cpp

This cmd will produce an a.out file. To run the App, type

./a.out

For a clean version of the App, cd into the out folder and type:

./craps.out

## API Reference

The libraries that were included for this App are:

iostream
string
stdlib.h
ctime

## Tests
